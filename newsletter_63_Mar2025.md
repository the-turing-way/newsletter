As part of [Open Data Day](https://opendataday.org/), we're hosting a Fireside Chat on 6 March titled: "Nurturing Open Science in Challenging Economic and Political times", at 14:00-15:30 BT/UTC. Chaired by **Esther Plomp** (University of Aruba - Aruba), this panel will feature insights from **Andrea Gomez** (ARcenso - Argentina), **Anelda van der Walt** (Talarify - South Africa), **Pen-Yuan Hsing** (MammelWeb - UK), and **Shern Tee** (The Turing Way/LAMMPS - Australia).

In this discussion, our panel of experts will discuss how the current political and economic landscape has shaped evolving practices in research and academia, impacting their communities and their own roles, highlighting what steps they are taking to stay resilient. 

Panellists will shed light on how their roles in their communities ensure that open science initiatives are sustained for the long term. While recognising the ongoing financial and political challenges in a changing research landscape, the panel will also share optimism and hopes for the future, focusing on the still growing global momentum for open science and its transformative potential to change research processes. 

Join us to hear how the open science movement is overcoming financial and political hurdles as they continue to shape the future of research!

## The Turing Way is now running on JupyterBook 2!

![Alt: Screenshot of two versions of the Turing Way that have a different design. The first features a large logo of The Turing Way among other navigational changes. The second features a smaller logo and other user experience differences](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/72c229c9-07d9-45fa-bfeb-bcb6403ae663.png?w=960&fit=max)

Since December 2024, the Infrastructure Working Group has been working to upgrade *The Turing Way* guide's infrastructure to JupyterBook 2. And recently, they merged a PR completing the upgrade!

JupyterBook been the backbone of the book since the beginning. This upgrade involves a number of large shifts in the underlying infrastructure as well as visually affecting the user experience.

As said by Danny on our community Slack: 
> This is alpha software, and so there is going to be some extra work in making this work, but we see this as an important way of supporting an upstream project.

Read more about the change on the [JupyterBook website](https://blog.jupyterbook.org/posts/2025-02-27-the-turing-way-upgrades-to-jb2), and read more about the upgrade on [this pull request](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/pull/4019) and [this issue](https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/issues/1336#issuecomment-2686398795).

Thank you to the Infrastructure Working Group, namely Sarah Gibson, Danny Garside, Jim Madge and Brigitta Sipőcz - co-chairs of the Working Group for spearheading this work!
