## Important Updates from April's Community Forum

At our last Community Forum on 17 April, alongside the share-outs from different Working Groups, we shared a few important updates about *The Turing Way* governance.

We thank Batool Almarzouq for chairing this call and for all presenters and attendees for their contributions.
Below we share important highlights - but you can catch up on the full discussion by [watching/listening to the recording on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKRtV_6xDLI&t=1s).

### *The Turing Way* Funding from The Turing Institute Comes to an End

Since 2019, *The Turing Way* has been generously supported by The Alan Turing Institute, which has provided funding to support the Project Delivery Team's roles and community events, and an affiliation that enabled us to nurture and scale our community-building and coordination efforts.
This institutional funding has now come to an end.

As of June 2025, the Institute will no longer be financially supporting *The Turing Way*.
Malvika announced this news at the Community Forum.
She adds, "We are deeply grateful to The Alan Turing Institute for their foundational support, which has been crucial to *The Turing Way*'s growth and success. We are proud that our work, developing globally recognised data science best practices through participatory approaches, now has strong community support.
While this is a significant shift in how we think about maintenance and sustainability going forward, this produces an opportunity to transition to a sustainable model supported by multiple groups, communities, and organisations that contribute to and benefit from our project and community engagement."

*Malvika has also shared a message for the community at the end of this newsletter. üíå*

### Project Delivery Team Members Transitioning in June

As part of this transition, Malvika shared that she will be leaving the Turing Institute in June, which also marks her last month in a funded role as *The Turing Way* Project Lead.
Anne Lee Steele also shared that her role as Research Community Manager will also end in June.

Malvika has been working with Arielle Bennett, appointed as Senior Researcher for Open Source Practices.
Arielle will lead the delivery of the next cohort of *The Turing Way* Practitioners Hub as part of the Turing-BridgeAI project.
L√©ll√© Demertzi will continue to work with Arielle and the BridgeAI team at the Turing.

Although this transition has limited the team's ability to currently support the wide range of projects we have in the past, they are committed to ensuring the uninterrupted day-to-day operations and community engagement of *The Turing Way* as the community members identify future support and funding.

### Focusing on Providing Continuity

While working with the Steering Committee, the Project Delivery Team has focused on strengthening the following areas across the three-level governance:

* **Community Level Governance**: We are addressing gaps in our processes and updating the Community Handbook to ensure that community processes are clearly documented.
* **Maintenance Level Governance**: We are supporting the establishment of Community Management Working Groups for daily support, and a Fundraising Working Group to identify funding.
* **Constitutional Level Governance**: We are formalising a Steering Committee with chairs/representatives from Working Groups and collaborative projects to guide The Turing Way's strategic direction.

After facilitating the handover of leadership to the Steering Committee's elected chair and Secretary, the Project Delivery Team will engage in *The Turing Way* Steering Committee to represent Working Groups and initiatives they are involved in.

Co-organised by Oscar Seip from SSI and Malvika and Arielle from *The Turing Way*, this series will explore different aspects of governance in open science and research.

The Community Forum on 19 June will launch the Fireside Chat series with a session with *The Turing Way* Steering Committee members.
The remaining monthly calls, running from June to November 2025, will dive deep into the following crucial topics of governance:

* **26 June**: What does Governance mean to us in Research and Open Science?, featuring insights from SSI leadership and Fellows.
* **31 July**: Learning from Each Other's Journeys: Case studies from Open Initiatives, featuring leaders from communities like The Carpentries, rLadies, OLS and Jupyter.
* **28 August**: Exploring Distributed, Collaborative and Decentralised Governance Models, featuring insights from The Climate Sensitive Infectious Disease Network (CSID Network), Open Research Community Accelerator (ORCA) and The Engine Room.
* **25 September**: Governance frameworks, examples and resources from open source networks, featuring leaders from CURIOSS, CHAOSS and Open Source Research.
* **30 October**: Good Governance Practices for the Long-Term Health of Open Initiatives, featuring researchers and leaders from Organizational Mycology and MetaDocencia.
* **November**: The series will wrap up at November's Book Dash. An announcement will be posted in our newsletter soon.

üìù **Mark your calendar and üîó [register to attend some or all the sessions](https://forms.gle/6Nh5W7ZvzcN3NGws8)**


## Contribute to the Fireside Chats

Unlike previous Fireside Chats, this year we will allocate 45 mins for speakers' discussion, followed by 45 minutes of interactions and dialogue between the speakers and attendees.
So, if you are curious or have a lot of interest and experience in governance, join us - your presence will make a difference.

We are looking for folks who would like to co-facilitate, take notes, develop creative outputs or support these events in any way.
You can express your interest in joining us by commenting under this [GitHub issue #11](https://github.com/the-turing-way/fireside-chats/issues/11).

The outcome of these events will be to gather insights and best practices that will directly inform the creation of resources in *The Turing Way* focused specifically on governance.
November's Book Dash will be partly dedicated to documenting these references.
To support this, you can join our Book Dash Working Group.

## Updates from our May Book Dash and Collaborations Workshop!

This year, we hosted a two-part Book Dash event across two weeks in May, working together with our community members both in person and online across various sessions for collaborative writing, social networking and knowledge exchange.

### Pre-Book Dash at Collaboration Workshop 2025

The first part of our Book Dash was hosted through a workshop at the Collaborations Workshop 2025 (CW25) in Stirling, Scotland.
This in-person session introduced participants to *The Turing Way*, our motivations for Book Dash, and various ways they could contribute, sparking ideas for their own contributions.

![Alt: A group picture from CW25 with four people sitting on the floor, six people standing behind - screenshots of four people have been edited next to the group picture. People's names are listed below.](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/1683a405-d664-4d39-a0a3-eeb918a2c098.png?w=960&fit=max)

*Sitting in the front (left to right) are L√©ll√© Demertzi, Batool Almarzouq, Irene Ramos and Sara Villa. Standing behind (left to right) are Saranjeet Kaur, Jez Cope, Arielle Bennett, Emma Karoune, Malvika Sharan, and Esther Plomp. Screenshot on the right side (from top to bottom) are Precious Onyewuchi, Alexandra Araujo Alvarez, Elspeth Haston and Jim Madge who participated in the Hack Day working on The Turing Way.*

The workshop was attended by both in-person and online attendees.
It led to a full-day hack day event where other members joined to work on different aspects of *The Turing Way*, including improving the 'Pathways' feature, community handbook and data management chapters.

Thanks to the Book Dash Planning Committee (details about them in a section below) for making this event truly a supportive space for all attendees to engage with each other.

### Hybrid Book Dash Events: 20-22 May

Our second Book Dash was a resounding success! Hosted remotely via Zoom on **May 20th & 21st**, it culminated in our vibrant Community Share-outs on May 22nd.

Over 30 participants joined us, contributing to 10 sessions and social events across the two days.
We were thrilled to welcome first-time contributors: Brenda Yankam, Cecilia Baldoni, Chanju Park, Mouhamadoul Amine Daffe, Ngu Asanga, Onana Anicet, Sebastian Ayala Ruano, Serena Asu Besong Agbor, and Jyoti Bhogal, several representing our collaboration with Data Science Without Borders initiative.

Returning members included: Denise Bianco, Liz Hare, Lucy Stephenson, Precious Onyewuchi, Reshama Sheikh, Richard J. Acton, Sara Villa, Sarah Gibson, Saranjeet Kaur, Gigi Kenneth, Jim Madge, and Johanna Bayer.
Onboarded, mentored, and supported by our dedicated Book Dash Planning Committee (named in the next section), participants tackled a range of topics -from improving infrastructure and documenting community processes to developing chapters. Their hard work resulted in an impressive **28 GitHub issues and 28 Pull Requests**!

![Alt: Two sets of screenshots from Zoom calls. Each from the social session where 14 people on the left are showing their water bottles/cups and 12 people on the right are showing a book each.](https://assets.buttondown.email/images/951f52f3-c6da-409b-8a5d-77dfde693d00.jpg?w=960&fit=max)

*Thanks to Patricia for facilitating the treasure hunt, and Sara for facilitating the show and tell. Pictured above are screenshots from the treasure hunt social session.*

### Thanks to the Book Dash Working Group and the Planning Committee

Thanks to **Arielle Bennett** for chairing this year's Working Group, and the planning committee members **Ale, Emma, Patrica, Esther, L√©ll√© and Anne**, who could gather in person in CW25, and Carlos Martinez and Seun Olufemi who supported at the planning stage.
They creatively pivoted the plan for Book Dash this May to ensure that our community members can enjoy a supportive space for productive and engaging experiences within the community!

A special shout out to **Precious** who as part of the planning committee and a community manager for  Data Science Without Borders (DSWB), held numerous 1:1s to onboard members from DSWB and support them in collaborative efforts, from writing new chapters to translating in French.

A huge congratulations to our incredible workshop hosts and the Book Dash planning committee for making these events possible.

## Message from Malvika

### A New Chapter for *The Turing Way* (and for us!)

In 2019, I joined *The Turing Way* as a community manager.
Since 2022, I have had the incredible privilege of co-leading it with Kirstie.
Following Kirstie's departure from the Turing in late 2024, my focus shifted to guiding our Project Delivery Team through *The Turing Way*'s transition from a flagship Turing project to an independent, community-governed initiative.

Over the last few months, working with the Project Delivery Team and our Steering Committee to establish governance processes has been an absolute honour.
Their commitment to open, transparent, and empowered governance is truly inspiring!

This direction perfectly embodies what *The Turing Way* truly is: so much more than a project, a global and thriving collaborative community.
While the changes announced in this newsletter mark the close of one significant chapter, they open the door to exciting new possibilities for us all.

As we move forward, I invite you to be an active part of this next discussion.
Please share your ideas and suggestions on how you can contribute!
Connect with us on Slack, share your thoughts on GitHub issue #4032, or email [theturingway@gmail.com](mailto:theturingway@gmail.com).
You can also reach out to me; details on [my webpage](https://malvikasharan.github.io/).
Your engagement will continue to shape its future.

I'm immensely grateful for the opportunity to have worked with, supported, and grown alongside this incredible community.
Thank you for your trust, and kindness, and for creating a brave space where I could learn to lead. I look forward to continuing to be a part of The Turing Way in a different capacity.

With gratitude,

*Malvika Sharan*, 
Alongside _The Turing Way_ Project Delivery Team
