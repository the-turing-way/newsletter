November 2025 - And then they were two!
  
It’s two months until 2025 ends, and for us at the Turing Way, it has been such a great year with different forms of growth, and experiences!

<span style="color: rgb(31, 35, 40)">Over the past few months we have been discussing </span> [<u>how to improve how we give access to The Turing Way's GitHub repositories</u>](https://github.com/orgs/the-turing-way/discussions/4357)<span style="color: rgb(31, 35, 40)">. We have arrived at a system which is simpler, more manageable, and more secure.</span>

<span style="color: rgb(31, 35, 40)">In short, we'll remove individuals as "external contributors", and instead manage access through teams, where each team will have appropriate permissions.</span>

<span style="color: rgb(31, 35, 40)">To read a detailed version of this announcement, follow through the decision making process, and contribute to the discussion, please </span> [<span style="color: rgb(31, 35, 40)">find the rest of the details on GitHub</span>](https://github.com/orgs/the-turing-way/discussions/4357#discussioncomment-14817922)<span style="color: rgb(31, 35, 40)">.</span>  
  
<span style="color: rgb(31, 35, 40)">We wanted to create awareness prior to the change.</span>  
  
**What will happen next?**

- ***(Until 17th Nov)*** We will circulate this in our Slack channels and next newsletter
- We have opened the #repository-access-migration channel in Slack for people to report problems or unexpected loss of access
- ***(Until 17th Nov)*** Working groups, and other teams, will confirm their groups membership in #repository-access-migration
- ***(W/C 17th Nov)*** GitHub teams will be updated
- ***(W/C 17th Nov)*** External contributors will be removed
- ***(W/C 17th Nov)*** Default membership role set to "read"
- ***(W/C 24th Nov)*** #repository-access-migration will be monitored, and changes made in response to problems or missing assignments

Thank you for sticking with us through these changes!

*👀* <span style="color: rgb(31, 35, 40)">Last week we wrapped up our Governance Fireside Chats series, co-organised with the Software Sustainability Institute, such a bittersweet moment!</span>  

![A flyer for the Turing Way Fireside Chat on "Exploring Governance in the Open". It has the image of the co-organisers. From left to right - Oscar Seip, Research Software Community Officer, Software Sustainability Institute. Malvika Sharan, Senior Researcher, The Alan Turing Institute.

<span style="color: rgb(31, 35, 40)">With around a hundred participants around all our calls, this series has been a tremendous success and has highlighted the importance of governance in open communities.</span>

  
We not only have learnt from Governance in The Turing Way, but also, and most importantly from other amazing communities like [SSI](https://www.software.ac.uk/), [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/), [2i2c](https://2i2c.org/), [OLS](https://we-are-ols.org/), [CSID Network](https://csidnet.org/), [ORCA](https://www.orcaopen.org/), [Engine Room](https://www.theengineroom.org/), Breathing Room, [R-Ladies+](https://rladies.org/), [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/), [Organizational Mycology](https://orgmycology.com/), [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community/), [CURIOSS](https://curioss.org/) and [Open Source Research](https://osrc.network/) and [Metadocencia](https://www.metadocencia.org/en/).

We have exchanged views, listened to one another, engaged in provoking discussions and created inspiring thoughts to keep creating agency and equity for everyone, so we can all work on a better version of ourselves and our work.

We thank all the speakers, the participants and the organisers of this series for these amazing months, and we are looking forward to work on all the materials and notes from this experience to work on a Governance chapter.

And if you missed this series... don't worry! You can still catch up with [our Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBxcQEfGu3Dnyw035fMTH7S_cAompfiSz)! :)
