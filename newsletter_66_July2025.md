## Fill out Arielle Bennett’s survey: [From code to contributions - exploring attitudes to open source in academia](https://southampton.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_aXYKOkmKdvzbRiu)

📢 Calling all academic coders! We need your views on open source in academia  
With the new UKRI software policy around the corner, it's never been more important to have a frank discussion about how to encourage, recognise, and promote both the use and maintenance of open source software in ways that benefit both individuals and the whole community.

**How it'll be used:** Findings from this survey will be used in a policy briefing to help advocate for national policies which address common barriers at a structural level, and to develop practical recommendations for improving open source contribution levels across academia. Keep an eye out for a workshop at **RSEcon 2025** if you'd like to explore this topic in more depth. The survey will be open until **30 September 2025** and is open to researchers and research professionals anywhere in the world.
