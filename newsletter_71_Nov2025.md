<span style="color: rgb(35, 35, 51)"><em>Our aim is to leverage the expertise across our community, and we explicitly invite you to review our processes and recommend improvements. These calls are a mix of celebration, feedback, and opportunities to build connections with other organisations and initiatives around the world.</em></span>

The last **Book Dash** of the year took place from the 10th to the 13th of November, with our public Shareouts happening on the 14th November.

This year we had 2 local hubs: one in Aruba and another one in the Netherlands which left the participants with appetite for another dash next year! 🥳

We also hosted our virtual sessions as usual, with over 20 participants and lots of issues and PRs worked on during the week! Final report will be fully available soon 😃
