# A Note on Recent GitHub Access Changes 

Dear *Turing Way* community,

Some of you recently received an automated GitHub message saying you were “removed as a collaborator” from one of our repositories. This default wording from GitHub’s automated email felt abrupt and can be misleading for the previous contributors and collaborators in our community. As announced in our previous newsletter, Slack workspace and LinkedIn post, we want to reassure you about what this change actually means, and what it *does not* mean.

**What changed  
**As part of ongoing work to improve the security and sustainability of our project, we have moved from granting individual write access to all contributors, to managing permissions through GitHub teams. This ensures safer repositories, easier maintenance for volunteers, and a workflow aligned with common open source practices.

**What this *does not* mean**

- ❌ You were **not removed** from the community.
- ❌ Your contributions are **not lost** or devalued.
- ❌ You are **not prevented** from contributing and participating.

Your past work remains permanently credited, and <span style="color: #4338ca"><strong>you are always welcome to continue participating</strong></span>. You can still open issues, submit pull requests, join working groups, and collaborate as before.

**Why we made this change  
**Managing access through teams creates a consistent, transparent, and secure structure that protects the project and makes it easier for everyone to contribute safely. This is the standard approach in most FLOSS communities, and it ensures our workflows scale as the project grows.

**Thank you for your collaboration  
**Community is at the heart of *The Turing Way*. Whether you contribute regularly or occasionally, you are valued, appreciated and always acknowledged. We are grateful for everything you have done, and value your contributions in the future.

If you believe you need a different access level, please reach out in the <span style="color: rgb(24, 128, 56)">#repository-access-migration</span> Slack channel or contact us directly by email.

Thank you for your continued support, collaboration, and consideration for helping us build a more sustainable *Turing Way*.

With appreciation,  
**The Turing Way Steering Committee**
